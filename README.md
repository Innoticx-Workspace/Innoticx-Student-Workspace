🌱 Greenhouse Monitoring System – Project Overview
This project is a simple yet effective Greenhouse Monitoring System built using an ESP32 microcontroller and multiple environmental sensors. The system reads real-time data from:
- DHT11 sensor → measures temperature and humidity
- Soil moisture sensor → measures soil wetness level
- MQ2 gas sensor → detects harmful gases and smoke

The ESP32 collects all sensor values, processes them, converts raw readings into meaningful data (such as soil moisture percentage), and prints the results to the Serial Monitor. This setup allows continuous monitoring of important greenhouse conditions such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and air quality.
The project serves as a foundation for building a complete IoT-based greenhouse system, where the data can later be uploaded to cloud platforms like Firebase, MQTT dashboards, or IoT apps for remote monitoring and automation.
